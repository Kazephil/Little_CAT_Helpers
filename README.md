# Little CAT Tools

This repository is intended to host scripts written to simplify various repetitive or tedious tasks involving CAT tools, mostly in terms of handing the files used or generated by such tools.

Many of the scripts presented here are newly rewritten, improved (hopefully!), and more generally applicable versions based on my memory (and sometimes a few notes) of quick and dirty scripts I'd made at work a few years ago. A few are completely new, based on ideas I'd been wanting to try but never had the chance to work on.

Descriptions of the individual scripts can, for the time being, be found in the README in their subfolder.
