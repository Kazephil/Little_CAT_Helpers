# Little CAT Tools

This repository contains scripts intended to facilitate various repetitive or tedious tasks involving CAT tools or related translation tasks. They mostly cover the handling of files used or generated by such tools.

The majority of tools presented here draw on quick-and-dirty scripts I hacked together some time ago to address an immediate need. They have been rewritten from scratch to remove copy-and-pasted duplicate code and hardcoded information that should either be in a configuration file or obtained from the user. As such they are as much of a personal learning experiment as they are tools providing a useful, if limited, function.

Descriptions of the individual scripts can, for the time being, be found in the README in their subfolder.
